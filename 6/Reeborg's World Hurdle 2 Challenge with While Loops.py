# Reeborg's World Hurdle Challenge with a While Loop
# Reeborg has entered a hurdle race, but he does not know in advance how long the race is.
# Make him run the course, following a path similar to the one shown,
# but stopping at the only flag that will be shown after the race has started.
# What you need to know
# The functions move() and turn_left().
# The condition at_goal() and its negation.
# How to use a while loop.
# Your program should also be valid for world Hurdles 1.
