# You are going to write a program which will select a random name from a list of names.
# The person selected will have to pay for everybody's food bill.

# **Important**: You are not allowed to use the `choice()` function.

# **Line 8** splits the string `names_string` into individual names and puts them inside a **List** called `names`. For this to work, you must enter all the names as name followed by comma then space. e.g. name, name, name

# Example Input

# ```
# Angela, Ben, Jenny, Michael, Chloe
# ```
# Note: notice that there is a space between the comma and the next name.

import random
# Split string method
names_string = input("Give me everybody's names, separated by a comma. ")
names = names_string.split(", ")
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
#Get the total number of items in list.
num_items = len(names)
#Generate random numbers between 0 and the last index.
random_choice = random.randint(0, num_items - 1)
#Pick out random person from list of names using the random number.
person_who_will_pay = names[random_choice]

print(person_who_will_pay + " is going to buy the meal today!")
