# Make a rock, paper, scissors game.

# Inside the `Mail Merge Project.py` file,
# you('ll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: `rock`, `paper`, and `scissors`. '
# 'This will make it easy to print them out to the console.)

# Start the game by asking the player:

# *"What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."*

# From there you will need to figure out:
# * How you will store the user's input.
# * How you will generate a random choice for the computer.
# * How you will compare the user's and the computer's choice to determine the winner (or a draw).
# * And also how you will give feedback to the player.
