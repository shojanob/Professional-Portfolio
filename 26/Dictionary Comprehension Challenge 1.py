# You are going to use Dictionary Comprehension to create a dictionary called `result` that takes each
# word in the given sentence and calculates the number of letters in each word.
#
# Try Googling to find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.
#
# **Do NOT** Create a dictionary directly. Try to use **Dictionary Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.
